                          RECITATIVE — Fitzbattleaxe.
      
                  Oh, Zara, my beloved one, bear with me!
                  Ah, do not laugh at my attempted C!
                  Repent not, mocking maid, thy girlhood's choice—
                  The fervour of my love affects my voice!
      
                             SONG — Fitzbattleaxe.
      
                  A tenor, all singers above
                       (This doesn't admit of a question),
                            Should keep himself quiet,
                            Attend to his diet
                       And carefully nurse his digestion;
                  But when he is madly in love
                       It's certain to tell on his singing—
                            You can't do the proper chromatics
                            With proper emphatics
                       When anguish your bosom is wringing!
                  When distracted with worries in plenty,
                  And his pulse is a hundred and twenty,
                  And his fluttering bosom the slave of mistrust is,
                  A tenor can't do himself justice,
                       Now observe—(sings a high note),
                  You see, I can't do myself justice!
                  I could sing if my fervour were mock,
                       It's easy enough if you're acting—
                            But when one's emotion
                            Is born of devotion
                       You mustn't be over-exacting.
                  One ought to be firm as a rock
                       To venture a shake in vibrato,
                            When fervour's expected
                            Keep cool and collected
                       Or never attempt agitato.
                  But, of course, when his tongue is of leather,
                  And his lips appear pasted together,
                  And his sensitive palate as dry as a crust is,
                  A tenor can't do himself justice.
                       Now observe—(sings a high note),
                  It's no use—I can't do myself justice!
      
        Zara:     Why, Arthur, what does it matter?  When the higher
        qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
        notes of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance. Who
        thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky? Be-sides
        (demurely), you are not singing for an engagement (putting her
        hand in his), you have that already!
      
        Fitz.:    How good and wise you are!  How unerringly your
        practiced brain winnows the wheat from the chaff—the
        material from the merely incidental!
      
        Zara:     My Girton training, Arthur.  At Girton all is wheat, and
        idle chaff is never heard within its walls!  But tell me, is not
        all working marvelously well?  Have not our Flowers of Progress
        more than justified their name?
      
        Fitz.:    We have indeed done our best.  Captain Corcoran and I
        have, in concert, thoroughly remodeled the sister-
        services—and upon so sound a basis that the South Pacific
        trembles at the name of Utopia!
      
        Zara:     How clever of you!
      
        Fitz.:    Clever?  Not a bit.  It's easy as possible when the
        Admiral-ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere.  And so
        with the others.  Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
        idle Acts of Parliament, all have given their natural tal-ents
        full play and introduced reforms which, even in Eng-land, were
        never dreamt of!
      
        Zara:     But perhaps the most beneficent changes of all has been
        ef-fected by Mr. Goldbury, who, discarding the exploded theory
        that some strange magic lies hidden in the number Seven, has
        applied the Limited Liability principle to individuals, and every
        man, woman, and child is now a Company Limited with liability
        restricted to the amount of his declared Capital! There is not a
        christened baby in Utopia who has not already issued his little
        Prospectus!
