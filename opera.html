        RECITATIVE — Fitzbattleaxe.

            Oh, Zara, my beloved one, bear with me!
            Ah, do not laugh at my attempted C!
            Repent not, mocking maid, thy girlhood's choice—
            The fervour of my love affects my voice!

                      SONG — Fitzbattleaxe.
                        A tenor, all singers above
                 (This doesn't admit of a question),
                      Should keep himself quiet,
                      Attend to his diet
                 And carefully nurse his digestion;
            But when he is madly in love
                 It's certain to tell on his singing</p>

  <p class="speech"><h6 class="ZAR">ZAR:</h6>Why, Arthur, what does it matter?  When the higher
                 qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
                  hand in his), you have that already!</p>

  <p class="speech"><h6 class="FIT">FIT:</h6> How good and wise you are!  How unerringly your
                   practiced brain winnows the wheat from the chaff—the
                  material from the merely incidental!</p>

 <p class="song"><h6 class="ZAR">ZAR:</h6>    My Girton training, Arthur.  At Girton all is wheat, and
                  idle chaff is never heard within its walls!  But tell me, is not
                  more than justified their name?</p>

 <p class="song"><h6 class="FIT "> FIT:</h6>    We have indeed done our best.  Captain Corcoran and I
                     trembles at the name of Utopia!</p>

 <p class="speech"><h6 class="ZAR">ZAR:</h6>        How clever of you!</p>

 <p class="song"> <h6 class="FIT">FIT:</h6>    Clever?  Not a bit.  It's easy as possible when the
                     Admiral-ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere.  And so
                     never dreamt of! </p>
                     <p class="direction">(Exit Zara. Enter King dressed as Field-Marshal.)</p>

  <p><h6 class="KIN">KIN:</h6>     To a Monarch who has been accustomed to the uncontrolled
  use of his limbs, the costume of a British Field-Marshal is,
  perhaps, at first, a little cramping.  Are you sure that this is
  all right?  It's not a practical joke, is it?  No one has a keener
  sense of humor than I have, but the First Statutory Cabinet
  Council of Utopia Limited must be conduct-ed with dignity and
  impressiveness.  Now, where are the other five who signed the
  Articles of Association?</p>
